# PLC-Simulation-Projects
This repository showcases a series of PLC simulation projects developed using Connected Components Workbench (CCW) and Factory I/O. It includes ladder logic diagrams, project files, and recorded simulation videos from hands-on training sessions. These projects were created as part of my learning journey in industrial automation and PLC programming.
